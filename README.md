My first dip into C# as part of a class.

Requirements:
"Construct a console application which does the following:
    Prompts the user for two or more responses
    Stores those responses in variables
    Makes decisions (using conditional statements) to provide customized output based on users' input"
    
I chose to be as creative as possible within the time frame and given the very 1980's aesthetic of a console app,
chose to lean into in and learn various console-based methods as well as incorporating ascii art and 1980s creatures.
