My first dip into C# as homework for a class.

Requirements:
"Construct a console application which does the following:
    Prompts the user for two or more responses
    Stores those responses in variables
    Makes decisions (using conditional statements) to provide customized output based on users' input"
    
I chose to be as creative as possible within the time frame and given the very 1980's aesthetic of a console app,
chose to lean into in and learn various console-based methods as well as incorporating ascii art and 1980s creatures.

Input is validated in a variety of ways -- either by requiring specific responses*, or as the case of the user's name, letting
the user confirm whether their input is correct (while it may be abused, this prevents issues with names that contain special characters, special casing, etc.)

* At some point down the road this may need to be reworked.
